This program uses the MediaWiki API to upload a bunch of files to a wiki with the same description for each. Unlike similar tools, it only adds the description to the uploaded files; it does not do anything else (add other sections, set up a gallery, etc.).

Usage:
	mwuploadbulk APIurl files...
It will not seek down into subdirectories, but will look inside directories listed on the command line.

You will be asked for your wiki credentials and the file's description after the program starts.

This is go get-table; the only outside library used is http://code.google.com/p/gopass/ for the password prompt.

This is unpolished code by far; it should probably be rewritten... Still, bug reports and comments welcome.
